## Introduction

As projects grow, managing backend code for different applications and operating systems can become challenging. The Backend Collection repository aims to simplify this process by providing a single location to store backend implementations for multiple projects.

By keeping all backends in one repository, we encourage code reuse and collaboration between projects. Whether you're working on a web application, mobile app, or any software that requires backend support, this repository has got you covered.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a folder structure to organize backend code for different projects. Each project's backend code resides within its designated folder. Below is an overview of the repository structure
